This is a simple tool i've used for over a decade, whenever i find myself fully blocked 🧱.

Until now I would always recreate this on paper 📝 anytime I needed it.

This version is an "offline-first" standalone webpage you can download locally. 

There are four boxes where you dump your thoughts:

* Dreams 🌈
* Goals 🌄
* Actions ✅
* Fears 💀

You can enter things in any order, as they occur to you.

**Dreams** 🌈 is for write a top-level, wildly impractical vision of what you hope to achieve. It is about picturing a successfull end state.

**Goals** 🌄 are more targeted, realistic than "dreams" - they might even fit the famous smart model and be "specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, time-focused"

**Actions** ✅ are the steps, the "next-actions" (in [GTD]()-speak) that will help you progress toward your goals.

While dumping down the points above you might find your mind gives you a steady stream of problems and negative ideas. Those are written in the **Fears** 💀 column... any bugs, issues, blockers, problems, crises, terrors, worries, tricky questions, obstacles... all the bad things. Get them out of your head and onto the paper.

The first three boxes are just for show: it's in the **Fears** 💀 area that you uncover what's stopping you from making progress.
